# Introducing Exapture: The Screenshot Tool That Actually Gets It Right

As a developer, how many times have you needed to take a screenshot of a specific size? Maybe you're testing responsive designs, creating mockups, or documenting bugs. You fire up the built-in macOS screenshot tool, try to eyeball the dimensions, capture something that's "close enough," then realize it's 1283×797 when you needed exactly 1280×800.

Sound familiar? This frustration led me to build **Exapture** – a precision screenshot tool that solves the "close enough" problem once and for all.

## The Problem with "Good Enough" Screenshots

Most screenshot tools make you guess. You drag a rectangle, hope for the best, and then discover your "full HD" screenshot is actually 1917×1076. For developers and designers who need pixel-perfect accuracy, this workflow is maddening.

The built-in macOS tools are great for general use, but they lack precision. Third-party apps like Lightshot focus on quick sharing rather than exact dimensions. And premium tools like Snagit, while feature-rich, are overkill when you just need a precise rectangle.

## Enter Exapture: Precision by Design

Exapture takes a different approach. Instead of "draw and hope," it gives you **exact dimensions with a live preview**.

Here's how it works:

1. **Specify your dimensions** – `exapture --width 1920 --height 1080`
2. **See exactly what you'll capture** – A dotted red overlay follows your cursor
3. **Click when ready** – Right-click captures the exact area you see
4. **Done** – Perfect 1920×1080 screenshot saved to your desktop

No guessing. No "close enough." Just pixel-perfect screenshots every time.

## Why I Built This

As a developer, I constantly need screenshots for:
- **Testing responsive designs** – Does this look right at 1024×768?
- **Creating documentation** – Consistent image sizes for better layouts
- **Bug reports** – Exact reproductions at specific viewport sizes
- **Social media** – Twitter cards need to be 1200×630, not "about that size"

I got tired of the capture-measure-recapture cycle. There had to be a better way.

## The Technical Details

Exapture is built in Swift as a native macOS application. It uses:
- **CoreGraphics** for precise screen capture
- **AppKit** for the overlay window system
- **System accessibility APIs** for global mouse/keyboard monitoring

The key insight was creating a cursor-following overlay that shows exactly what will be captured. The dotted red border isn't just pretty – it's a pixel-perfect preview of your screenshot boundaries.

The app weighs in at just 1.5MB and requires minimal permissions (only accessibility access for mouse/keyboard monitoring). No network access, no telemetry, no bloat.

## Real-World Use Cases

Since releasing Exapture, I've discovered use cases I never considered:

**QA Engineers** use it to create consistent bug reports with exact browser dimensions.

**Content Creators** generate social media images with precise aspect ratios.

**Students** create presentations with uniform screenshot sizes.

**Designers** capture UI elements at exact pixel dimensions for mockups.

**DevOps Teams** include it in automation scripts for visual regression testing.

## Open Source and Free

Exapture is completely open source under the MIT license. You can audit the code, contribute improvements, or fork it for your own needs. The entire codebase is available on GitHub.

This isn't a freemium tool with paid upgrades. It's a focused utility that does one thing exceptionally well, and it's free forever.

## Try It Yourself

Getting started takes 30 seconds:

```bash
# Install via Homebrew
brew tap lXXXw/tools
brew install exapture

# Or download directly
curl -L https://github.com/lXXXw/exapture/releases/latest/download/exapture -o exapture
chmod +x exapture
sudo mv exapture /usr/local/bin/
```

Then try it:
```bash
exapture --width 1280 --height 800
```

Move your mouse around, see the dotted overlay, right-click to capture. Press ESC to exit.

## What's Next

I'm considering features like:
- **Preset sizes** for common use cases
- **Multiple format support** (JPEG, WebP)
- **Batch capture mode** for multiple screenshots
- **Integration with design tools**

But the core philosophy remains: precision first, simplicity always.

## The Bottom Line

If you've ever needed a screenshot of an exact size, Exapture will save you time and frustration. It's the tool I wish existed when I started facing this problem daily.

No subscription, no account required, no feature creep. Just precise screenshots when you need them.
